Proofs -Basic
---------------
3. It is good when you introduce a variable to say if you mean 'for all' or 'for some / there exists' (e.g. 'for some integer k' here)

4. When you try to prove something involving an existential quantifier, you don't assume it exists (since you want to show that). For example, here instead of 'assume that z is a real number, such that..', you can say just 'Let z=(y-x)/2. Then z is a real numbers and ...'

5b. What are a,b,c,d? Introducing a new variable always write what it represents.

7. You have nicely proven that the statement you wrote. However, you were asked to prove there exists UNIQUE such y. Therefore, you still need to start by some y_0 satisfying the equation and show that y_0=x/(2-x).

3. This works when n>0. However, for n=0 it is not true that 2|1.

8. Great proof! You also caught the case where m=0, so it is not true that pq=1, which most people missed.

10b. What you use is that P^#(2) implies P(0), P(1) and P(2), not the other way around (which also holds) to conclude that P^#(2) is false.

Great work!

On numbers

3. To prove the equalities here, you need to use use/show two things: That rem(a,b)=r is the unique integer such that
-> there exists an integer m, such that a=mb+r
-> r is between 0 and b-1 (inclusive)
