# Question 47

Please see Averages.java for the code.

The regular for loop and for each loop implementations are almost identical, except for the for condition. The for each loop is arguably the better choice in this case as it is more concise, and it is clearer what it does by just looking at it, and each element can directly be used within the loop rather than having to get it from the list.

The iterator approach is different to the first two, and is a better approach as iterators are more optimised for iteration than lists such as LinkedLists so performance will be better.
