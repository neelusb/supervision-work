# Question 45

- An ArrayList is an array, i.e. can get and set elements directly, and dynamically grows to add new elements.
- A LinkedList is a list and therefore takes O(n) time to get and set elements as the list has to be traversed from the head to the element in question. However it implements Queue in addition to List and therefore has access to additional methods.
- A Vector is functionally identical to an ArrayList, except that it is synchronised. This means that only one thread can access it at a time, so you don't get multiple threads trying to get or set the same element at the same time, minimising inconsistencies.
- A TreeSet organises elements into a balanced binary tree in ascending order using a comparator. This has the advantage of being faster on average than all three kinds of list (taking O(logn) time), but the disadvantage of not preserving insertion order.
