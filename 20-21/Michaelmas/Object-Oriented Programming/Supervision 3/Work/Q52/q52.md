# Question 52

## Part (a)

A `TreeMap` uses natural ordering of its keys so it can be used to keep the collection sorted alphabetically by manufacturer without writing a Comparator by making the keys the manufacturer names and the values the ages, as shown in `Car.java` and `CarsWithoutComparator.java`.

## Part (b)

A comparator can be used to sort first by manufacturer and then by cost, and using this approach a TreeMap is not necessary and a list can be used instead, as shown in `Car2.Java` and `CarsWithComparator.java`.
