# Question 48

In Object comparisons using ==, Java compares references rather than values of the objects. 

In the first part, two separate String objects are being explicitly created, and therefore comparing them returns false as even though their contents are the same, they are different objects with different references.

In the second part, you aren't creating two separate objects explicitly and Java will therefore use the same object for both by inferring that they are equivalent as they have the same contents, so the references will also be the same.
