# Question 57

Arrays in Java are covariant. This means that an array of type `T[]` may contain objects of any subtype of `T`. This may lead to some runtime errors.

Consider the following:

```java
String[] s = new String[] {"x", "y", "z"};
``` 
`String` is a subtype of `Object`, so the following works:

```java
Object[] t = s;
```

This is a perfectly valid array as `String` is a subtype of `Object`, so this array `t` can be used just as `s` can, and queried using `t[1]` and so on.

However, now consider the following:

```java
t[1] = new Integer(0);
```

The compiler thinks everything is okay as `t` is an `Object[]`, and `Integer` is a subtype of `Object`. However, `t` is actually a `String[]`, which isn't apparent until runtime, so this fails at runtime.
