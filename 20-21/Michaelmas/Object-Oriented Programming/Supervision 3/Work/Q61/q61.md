# Question 61

## Approach 1 (Integers)

The first approach explicitly defined integers to represent different states, and dealt with each of these states within the main method. The drawbacks of this approach are that this would fail when an integer not mapped to a state was used, and a lot of code needs to be changed to add a new state.

## Approach 2 (`enum`)

The second approach is similar to above but uses `enum` which allows you to define states, and no states apart from these will work, so this solves the first problem of undefined states, but it still takes a lot of work to add new states and there is a lot of repeated code.

## Approach 3 (Interface)

The third approach defines an interface `FanSpeed`, and classes for each state that implement this interface. This obviously solves the first problem as there are no arbitrary integers involved, but also solves the second problem as it is easy to add new states and modify existing ones, simply by creating a new class that implements `FanState` and changing only the classes of the states that transition into the new state. It is also easy to modify behaviour of each state simply by modifying the relevant methods within the class.

This demonstrates the open-closed principle, as the class is open for extension simply by implementing the `FanState` interface and defining the relevant methods, but class is closed for modification as none of the methods within the class need to be modified when adding a new state or modifying states.
