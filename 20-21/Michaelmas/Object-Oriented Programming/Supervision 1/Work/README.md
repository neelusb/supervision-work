1. Done
2. The completed code is at https://chime.cl.cam.ac.uk/page/repos/srns2/fibonacci/code.
3. *TODO*
4. In an imperative language, the programmer tells the compiler what to do by specifying clear, distinct steps to reach a goal, i.e. they tell the compiler exactly how to perform a task. In a functional language, the programmer tells the compiler what needs to happen, but not exactly how to do it. Therefore, an imperative language has state which can be changed, while a functional language is completely stateless and all that exists on the stack is what is passed into functions as arguments. Functional languages are generally far more readable, but their lack of state makes purely functional languages much harder or even impossible to use for more complex tasks.
5. Please see TailRecursion.java. Tail recursive operations do seem to be slightly faster on average so it appears that this implementation of Java does perform tail recursion optimisations.
6. Please see LowestCommon.java.
