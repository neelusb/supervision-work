# Exercise 34

Adding to the end is probably the easiest and most efficient way to do it. If you were to add the new element, say X, in the middle somewhere, say between elements P and Q, you would have to change the next element pointer of P to point to X (as it was originally pointing to Q) in addition to setting the next element pointer of X to point to Q. If you add to the end, you only have to set the next element pointer of the last element to point to X, so only one pointer change is required. If you add it to the start, the dictionary has a new start position so any pointers pointing to the list elsewhere in the code would have to be updated.
