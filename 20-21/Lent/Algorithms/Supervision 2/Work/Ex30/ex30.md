# Exercise 30

An empty list is represented by having a null value for its head, so an `isEmpty()` method can easily be added which checks whether the head is `null`. However a problem is that an empty list must also have an empty tail, and an empty list itself isn't null, it just has a head that's null, so we need to enforce that the tail is a specific value if the head is null, which is already not what you want in OOP, but also that it is another empty list, i.e. a list with a null head, and not a null value itself.

We could remedy these problems by making a null list just `null` rather than a list with a null head, but then it wouldn't have access to the methods of the object, and we couldn't call `isEmpty()` on it.

We could solve just the second problem by making an empty list's tail `null` rather than another empty list, and returning an empty list if its tail method is called, but this is a rather clunky solution and doesn't fix the fact that we need to make sure the tail is a certain value if the head is null. However this is the best solution I can come up with.
