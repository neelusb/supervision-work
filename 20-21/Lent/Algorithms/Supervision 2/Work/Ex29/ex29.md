# Exercise 29

We can define a list analogously to a ListWagon, and an empty list can be represented with a null head.

In the C case:

```c
struct List {
    int *head;
    struct List *tail;
}
```

```java
class List {
    Integer head;
    List tail;
}
```

We can create an empty list by setting the `head` of the list to `null`, which is why the head was changed from an `int` to an `int` pointed in C and to an `Integer` in Java. However this doesn't really maintain a clear distinction between List and ListWagon.
