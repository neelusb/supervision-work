# Exercise 27

Let the knapsack have 3 items:

| Item | £   | kg  | £/kg |
| ---- | --- | --- | ---- |
| 1    | 5   | 4   | 1.20 |
| 2    | 6   | 6   | 1.00 |
| 3    | 10  | 8   | 1.25 |

Let's say the most you can carry is 10kg. The highest £/kg is item 3 at 1.25, but picking it, you can't pick any other items as either of the others would bring the total above 10kg, so the total you have is £10. However if you pick items 1 and 2 instead, you can get £11, a greater amount than just item 3.
