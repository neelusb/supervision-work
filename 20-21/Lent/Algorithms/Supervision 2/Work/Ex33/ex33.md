# Exercise 33

A simple way to do it would be to have a list containing binary representations of the keys (the English words), and with a pointer pointing to the relevant part of memory that contains the value, and a pointer pointing to the next element in the dictionary. However this would involve going through the list until the key is found, but it does mean that you can easily set and get elements in linear time, and you can change the size of the dictionary and preserve the order.
