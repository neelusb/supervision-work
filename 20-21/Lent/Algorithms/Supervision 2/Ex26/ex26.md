# Exercise 26

The fact that there can be multiple common subsequences is shown by the fact that there are multiple possible routes you could take to get to the top or the left from the bottom right. For example, consider the strings ABCD and BACD:

|          |  ""  | B j=1 | BA j=2 | BAC j=3 | BACD j=4 |
|:--------:|:----:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| ""   i=0 |  0   |   0   |   0    |    0    |     0    |
| A    i=1 |  0   |   0   |   1    |    1    |     1    |
| AB   i=2 |  0   |   1   |   1    |    1    |     1    |
| ABC  i=3 |  0   |   1   |   1    |    2    |     2    |
| ABCD i=4 |  0   |   1   |   2    |    3    |     3    |

We start at the bottom right at (i, j) = (4, 4). We move diagonally up to (3, 3), adding "D" to the start of our string. We then move diagonally up to (2, 2) adding "C" to the start of our string, so we get "CD". Now we are at (2, 2) which has a value of 1. We can either move diagonally to (1, 1), adding a "B" to the start of our string to get "BCD", or we can first move up to (1, 2) and then move diagonally to (0, 1), adding an "A" to the start of our string to get "ACD".

We can get every possible subsequence of the longest length by taking all these different paths and constructing the strings that result.
