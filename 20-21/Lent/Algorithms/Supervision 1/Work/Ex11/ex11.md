# Exercise 11

`smallest(a1, i1, a2, i2)` gives us the lowest of the two values `a1[i1]` and `[a2[i2]]` but also updates either the index `i1` or `i2`, while `min(a1[i1], a2[i2])` only gives us the lower value and does not update `i1` or `i2`. Also, if we have reached the end of one of the arrays but not the other, trying to find the nth element of the n element array would throw an index error, so we would have to check whether we have reached the end of one of the arrays and deal with that accordingly.

My preferred way of solving this would be to use `min()` and then explicitly add 1 to either `i1` or `i2` on a separate line of code. This approach is shown in the `merge_sort.py` file.

If we had to use `smallest`, we have two choices of implementation:
- We would either have to pass the indices by reference to update the indices themselves which isn't always possible with a primitive type such as an integer, or
- We would have to return the lower value, as well as the two indices, and set those.
- In either case, we would have to check whether we have reached the end of one of the arrays and deal with that accordingly if we have.

The major advantage of using `min()` and then explicitly setting `i1` or `i2` is that it is very clear what that does, while the function `smallest()` is a bit confusing to understand just by looking at it. An advantage of using `smallest()` is that it does more things in a single line of code and abstracts away the changing of indices and checking whether we have reached the end of an array into a separate function.
