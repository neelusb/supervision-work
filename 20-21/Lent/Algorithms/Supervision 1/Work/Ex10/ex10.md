# Exercise 11

After the first pass, the final 2 elements will be swapped with each other if necessary and are guaranteed to be sorted with respect to each other.

After the next pass, the third last element will be swapped with the second last if necessary, and the (new) second last will be swapped with the last if necessary, so the final 3 elements are sorted with respect to each other.

This continues, and after n - 1 passes, all n elements are sorted with respect to each other, i.e. the entire list is sorted.

A final pass is then required to check that the entire array is sorted.

Therefore, no more than n passes are required to sort the array. This means that the outer loop (which is run once per pass) needs to be run no more than n times.
