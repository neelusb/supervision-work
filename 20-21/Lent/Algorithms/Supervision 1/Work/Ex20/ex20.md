# Exercise 20

You compare the first element against the second, and keep track of the smallest one and the second smallest one (in this case the bigger one). Then we compare the second smallest one against the third one. If it is smaller, then so is the smaller one and we don't need to make any more comparisons, the smallest and second smallest remain the same, and we move on to the fourth element. If it is larger, then we also need to compare the smallest one against it. If the smallest one so far is smaller than the fourth one, then the fourth one is the new second smallest and the smallest doesn't change. If it is larger, then the fourth one is the new smallest, and the old smallest is the new second smallest.

Therefore, in the best case where we only need to compare the smallest against each subsequent element, we only make n-1 pairwise comparisons. In the worst case where we need to make the second comparison for each one, we make 1 comparison at the start, and then 2 for each subsequent element in the remaining array of n-2, so we make a total of 2(n-2) + 1 = 2n-1 pairwise comparisons.

Therefore the best case is n-1 pairwise comparisons, and the worst case is 2n-1 pairwise comparions.
