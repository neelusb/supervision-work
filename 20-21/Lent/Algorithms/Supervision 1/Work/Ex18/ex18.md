# Exercise 18

Even though insertsort is quadratic, it works really efficiently when elements are close to their final positions, which is the case when quicksort has been run for several iterations. We choose a threshold by balancing the efficiency of quicksort on larger arrays with the efficiency of insertsort on smaller arrays or large arrays where each element is close to its final position.
