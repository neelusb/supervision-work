# Exercise 16

A full binary tree of height n has a total of 2^n elements. This can be proven as follows:

Any given row k of a full binary tree has 2^k elements (starting counting from k = 0). This is because the 0th level has 1 tree, and every node has two children so every level has 2 times as many nodes as the level before it.

Therefore to find the number of elements of a full binary tree of height n, we add up all the elements from the first (n + 1) rows, as there is always one more level than the height, i.e. from the 0th row to the nth row, inclusive.

This is 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^n, which is 2^(n+1) - 1.

In a heap of height h, the final level may or may not be full, but every other level is. Let's first ignore the final level and think about all the higher levels.

The higher levels form a full binary tree of height h - 1, and therefore have a combined 2^h - 1 elements.

Now the final level: the fewest elements it can have is 1, and the most it can have is a full row, i.e. 2^h.

Therefore the minimum total number of nodes is (2^h - 1) + 1 = 2^h.

The maximum total number of nodes is (2^h - 1) + 2^h = 2\*2^h - 1 = 2^(h+1) - 1.
