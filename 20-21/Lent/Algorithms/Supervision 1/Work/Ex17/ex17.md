# Exercise 17

An ideal pivot needs to be as close to the median of the values as possible. If we don't know anything about the array then we have no reason to choose a random element over the last one as there is just as much chance of the last element being close to the median as any other. Therefore the average case remains O(nlgn) and the worst case remains O(n^2). 

However if we know that the array is likely closer to sorted than to random then picking a random pivot helps as the last element is likely further from the median than a different element might be. However the random element might still be the furthest from the median so the worst case is still O(n^2). The average case is still O(nlgn) but we are more likely to hit this average case than by selecting the final element.
