# Exercise 14

As explained in Exercise 13, we have two arrays:
- Array 1 of length n, with the first n/2 spaces clear and the final n/2 spaces having the first sorted group.
- Array 2 of length n/2 containing the second sorted group.

Every time we select an element from group 1, that takes up a space at the start of array 1, but clears a space at the start of the end of array 1, as we only ever take elements from the start of the groups. This means every time we select an element from group 1 it is just moved from the end of the gap to the start of the gap, so the size of the gap does not change.

The size of the gap is n/2 to begin with, which is the exact size of array 2, so it can fit every element of array 2. When an element from array 2 is selected, the size of the gap decreases by 1, but so does the number of elements in array 2, so every element in array 2 can still fit into the gap and would not overwrite any elements in the first group (the group at the end of array 1).
