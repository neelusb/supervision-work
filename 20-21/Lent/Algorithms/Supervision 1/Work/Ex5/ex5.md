# Exercise 5

It is still O(n^2). This is because even though there are fewer assignments for each iteration which makes the program more efficient, asymptotic complexity is about the rate of growth as the input size increases and not the absolute time it takes, and the number of assignments still increase quadratically with the size of the input.
