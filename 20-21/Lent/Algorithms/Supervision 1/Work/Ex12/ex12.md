# Exercise 12

If the array that is received from the caller is later modified by the caller, then if a new array was returned by the function the new array is not modified. However if the original array was returned then the caller later modifying this array would modify the returned sorted array, which may not be what the caller is expecting, so modifying the array passed in could have consequences or not depending on what return line is run, which is inconsistent and could cause confusion to the caller.
