# Exercise 13

We have our original array of length n, and we create a new workspace of length n/2. We recursively sort the two groups of the array independently, so we have 2 groups of length n/2 sorted with respect to themselves. We put one of them at the end of the original array of length n (let's call this array 1). We put the other in the array of length n/2 (let's call this array 2). 

Now have have n/2 spaces at the beginning of array 1. We take the smaller first element of the sorted groups and put it at the start of array 1. This frees up a space in one of the arrays: and if the array is array 1, this is a space which a new element can go into. This means that we will never need more than n/2 spaces in temporary space, as every time we sort an element in array 1 and move it to the start of array 1, it clears a space for a new element in array 1. When we sort an element in array 2, we obviously don't clear a space in array 1 but this still does not cause any problems for reasons explained in Exercise 14.

Since the recursive calls will be on arrays of length n/2, the temporary space needed for each of those is n/4, which is less than n/2, so we only need a temporary workspace with n/2 spaces.
