# Question 7

My solution to question 5 satisfies Comrade B, as the edges between each Demand vertex and the sink have infinite capacity, so any net flow that out of a Demand vertex ends up in the sink. To satisfy Comrade A, we need to make sure no more and no less than d_v ends up at any Demand vertex D. To ensure no more ends up we could just change the capacity of the edge from D to the sink to d_v, so if there is any more it can't get to the sink, therefore it can't stop at D. I am not sure how to make sure no less than d_v ends up at D, as I can't think of a way to stipulate both a minimum flow and a maximum flow through an edge.
