# Question 4

A simple way to translate this into a normal max-flow problem is to keep all edges in the flow network exactly the same, and turn each vertex into two vertices connected by two edges (one in each direction) with a capacity equal to the capacity of the original vertex. That way, all flows through each edge in the original network and the new network abide by the same constraints as they have not been modified, and flows through a vertex abide by the constraint of the edges linking them, which has the same capacity as the vertex, and since there are edges in both directions, the flow can go either way, and just depends on the direction of the edges in the original network.
