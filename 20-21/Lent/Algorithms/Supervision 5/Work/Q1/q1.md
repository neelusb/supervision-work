# Question 1

It took me 2 iterations: once through the upper 1000 path and once through the lower.

The worst case scenario would be if the first augmenting path found was through the path with capacity 1 (s -> a -> b -> t), and then once again through the flow 1 path but this time from the bottom (s -> b -> a -> t). At this point, the a -> b edge would have flow 0, and the others flow 1. Then, the same process could be repeated to get flow 2 in each, and flow 0 in a -> b again, and this continues. Therefore the worst case scenario would take 2000 iterations before it finally got to the end result of 1000 through each edge and 0 through the a -> b edge and terminated.
