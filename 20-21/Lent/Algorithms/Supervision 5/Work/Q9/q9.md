# Question 9

## Part (a)

This would not be an MST in the original graph, for a similar reason to why the idea presented in Example Sheet 4 Question 16 for an augmented graph in Johnson's algorithm. To summarise, a path between two vertices could have different numbers of edges depending on the two vertices so the constant increase in edge weight would be applied unevenly.

## Part (b)

Prim's algorithm is based on Dijkstra's algorithm, and for the same reason as in Dijkstra's algorithm, it would work fine in a graph with negative edge weights if there are no negative weight cycles (although it may violate the assertion of a vertex not being inserted back into the priority queue once it has been removed), but if there are any negative weight cycles the algorithm may get stuck in an infinite loop.
