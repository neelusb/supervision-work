# Question 5

What we have is a flow network with three different kinds of vertices: 
- Supply (Sources)
- Demand (Sinks)
- Interconnection points (Normal intermediate vertices)

So we have a problem identical to the normal max flow problem, with the single exception of the fact that we have multiple sources and sinks. What we can do to translate this into a single source-single sink problem is to add two new vertices: one source and one sink, and create an edge connecting the new source to each Supply vertex, and an edge connecting each Demand vertex to the new sink. Each of these edges have an infinite capacity.
