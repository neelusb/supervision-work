# Question 11

Reversing the direction of all edges in a directed acyclic graph results in another directed acyclic graph. The first part of this ('directed') is trivially true: if a directed graph's edges are reversed then obviously all edges in the new graph are also directed, they have the opposite direction. Here is a proof by contradiction of the acyclic property:

Let A be a DAG and B be A with all of its edges reversed. Assume B is not acyclic. Let u1 -> u2 -> ... -> un -> u1 be a cycle in B. Since reversing each edge in A resulted in B, reversing each edge in B results in A. Reversing each edge in this cycle results in u1 -> un -> ... -> u2 -> u1, which is a cycle, resulting in a contradiction of the fact that A is acyclic. Therefore B is acyclic as required.
