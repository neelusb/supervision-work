# Question 13

Dijkstra's algorithm returns the correct result for the first graph, however it violates the assertion that a vertex is never put back into the priority queue once it has been popped, as the lowermost vertex gets put into the priority queue after it has been popped.

Dijkstra's algorithm gets stuck in an infinite loop in the second graph as it contains a negative-weight cycle.
