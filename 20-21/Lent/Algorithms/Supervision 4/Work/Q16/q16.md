# Question 16

The problem with this approach is that it would decrease the path lengths by different amounts depending on the number of edges visited. For example, take a graph with 3 vertices: A, B, and C. Say there is an edge from A to B with weight 2, B to C with weight 2, and A to C with weight 3. There are therefore two paths from A to C: A -> C (total cost = 3), and A -> B -> C (total cost = 4). Therefore the path with the lowest cost would be A -> C.

In this case, w* would be 2 (the minimum weight in the graph). Decreasing each weight in the graph by that amount, we get a graph with edges A -> B of weight 0, B -> C of weight 0, and A -> C of weight 1. The two paths from A to C are now A -> C (total cost = 1) and A -> B -> C (total cost = 0). Now the path with the lowest cost is A -> B -> C, which is not the path with the lowest cost in the original graph.
