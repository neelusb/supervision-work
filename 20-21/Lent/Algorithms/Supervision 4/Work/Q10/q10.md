# Question 10

Let the graph indexed by k have k vertices, and have edges connecting a single one of these vertices (call it v) to each of the other vertices, and let the graph have no other edges. Therefore the graph has k-1 edges, which is Theta(k^alpha), with alpha = 1. Dijkstra's algorithm has a running time of Omega(E + VlogV) = Omega(k^alpha + klogk) as required.
