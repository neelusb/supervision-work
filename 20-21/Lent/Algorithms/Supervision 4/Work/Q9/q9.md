# Question 9

For any vertex w, w.distance can only change when it is the neighbour of another vertex v that has just been popped. Once this distance is changed, either the key of v in the priority queue is decreased (i.e. v is already in the priority queue), or v is added to the priority queue. Since u_{i-1} has been popped, it is not in the priority queue so if u_{i-1}.distance changed it would be added to the priority queue, which violates our assertion that a vertex is never put back into the priority queue once it is popped, so by contradiction, u_{i-1}.distance can't have changed between t' and t.
