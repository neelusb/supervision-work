# Exercise 46

Everything to the left of a key (in the same level and in the left subtree) is smaller than the key and everything to the right (in the same level and in the right subtree) is larger. The key to the right of the key in question within its node, if one exists, is larger than the key in question, and everything in between the two keys is in the subtree between these two keys, so the direct successor of the key in question is in its right subtree. Furthermore, the successor is the smallest key larger than the key in question, so once we descend into the right subtree, we take the leftmost path down every time as it will be larger than the key we want to find the successor of, and smaller than every key in the level it's in as well as every key in the subtrees in the same level. We keep doing this until we cannot go any further down and this is the minimum, and is in the bottom layer. Therefore the successor is in a bottom node.
