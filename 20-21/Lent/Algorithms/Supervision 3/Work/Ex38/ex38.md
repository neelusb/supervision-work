# Exercise 38

To find the minimum of a BST, we keep going left until there's no left child, as an element to the left will always be lower so the furthest bottom-left is the lowest we can get.

To find a successor to a node, we want the smallest element that is larger than it. We want the element to be larger so we descend into the right subtree. We then want the smallest one that's larger so we find the minimum of this subtree, i.e. keep going left until there's no left child, and the last one is the successor. Therefore the successor cannot have a left child, as if it did we'd descend into that child to find the successor.
