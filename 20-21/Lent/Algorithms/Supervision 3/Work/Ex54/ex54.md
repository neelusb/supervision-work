# Exercise 54

This proof was already given in exercise 53 but has been copied and pasted here too:

Say a binomial heap has n nodes. We want a combination of binomial trees whose numbers of nodes add up to n. A binomial tree of order k has 2^k elements. We therefore want a certain sum of powers of 2 that add up to n. This is easily found by converting n into a binary number and looking for the 1s. For example, say we want to build a binomial heap with 12 nodes. 12 in binary is 10100. Therefore 12 = 2^2 + 2^4, so we need a binomial tree of order 2 and one of order 4.
