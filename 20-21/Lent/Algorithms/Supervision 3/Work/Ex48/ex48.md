# Exercise 48

Each entry in the table is a pointer to a record containing the key and a pointer to the associated satellite data. When we arrive at the entry to retrieve an element, we go to the record that the pointer points to and check its key. If the key is the key we are looking for, we follow the pointer to its satellite data to get it. If the key is something else, then we go back and check the pointer of the subsequent entry given by the probing function.
