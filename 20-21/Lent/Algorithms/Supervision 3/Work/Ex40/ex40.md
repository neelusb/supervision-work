# Exercise 40

The largest possible number of nodes is straightforward, it occurs when every level of the tree is full. Therefore a red-black tree of height h can have a maximum of 2^(h+1) - 1 nodes.

A red-black tree always has the same number of black nodes in every path, so the most extra levels you can have is 1, as anything beyond that you'd need another black. Therefore the minimum number of nodes has a single red node in the bottom layer, i.e. the h^th layer. The h^th layer has a capacity of 2^h nodes, so we have 2^h - 1 fewer nodes than max capacity of the tree, i.e. (2^(h+1) - 1) - (2^h - 1) = 2^h nodes is the minimum number of nodes a red-black tree can have.
