# Exercise 50

Bubblesort is a quadratic algorithm because it has two loops: The outer loop (which is linear) iterates through the array until each element is in the right place. The inner loop (also linear) runs through the array once each time swapping elements that need to be swapped.

To change a priority queue, bubblesort is a linear algorithm because the outer loop isn't required. All the elements are already in order except for the single element whose priority was changed. The inner loop takes this element along the array swapping it as required. Therefore this is the only loop required so only n - 1 comparisons are made, and fewer than n - 1 swaps. Therefore in this case bubblesort has linear cost.
